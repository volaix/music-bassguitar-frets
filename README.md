Know the frets you're playing on the bass at all time.

##Coloured Music Frets
Print out the a4, cut it out, tape it to your fretboard. Know your frets forever.

I originally just used paper and clear cello tape. Currently sending it to a vinyl printer to get it done more permanently. Merry Christmas present to myself.

##Colours?
Ive tried many colour themes for getting things 'legit'. Originally tried LAB colour spacing in 12. Then HSB Max Saturation, the wheel/12. Settled on using this graphic found by Sienna Wood.

LAB Colour wasn't great because the colours didnt seem spaced out enough, and clumped to the 4 primaries.

HSB Max Saturation wasn't great because max saturation doesn't take into account the greyscale value. Yellow at max saturation is super bright, whereas blue is quite dark.
I had edited these to be more similar in value, then realised it started to look like the image from Sienna Wood anyway.
As I have already memorised her colours, I thought I may aswell reuse it. I've buffed some colour differentiation for all the colours though. i.e. red is darker and more saturated, the greens/blues are more seperated (adding magenta to darken some etc)

tl;dr settled on a modified Sienna Wood palette due to self history in remembering colours.

In the illustrator file, the fret colours are mapped to the swatches. Therefore, you can change the swatches to change the fret colours globally.

##Conception
Tried this out really roughly a year ago. Never looked back. Best feeling ever to always know what note youre playing. No longer playing blind.
On instruments where I don't have the letters written out for me, I've picked up patterns and know 'key marks' anyway. The marks have assisted immensely Super recommended.

##Feedback
If anyone actually uses this please let me know! We can be colour bass friends!
