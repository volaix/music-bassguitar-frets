Tried this out really roughly a year ago. Never looked back. Best feeling ever to always know what note youre playing. No longer playing blind.

On instruments where I don't have the letters written out for me, I've picked up patterns and know 'key marks' anyway. The marks have assisted immensely Super recommended.

Know the frets you're playing on the bass at all time. Sick of guess work, and octave/5th calculations. Don't play 'blind' again.

## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

You'll need a Bass
And an Adhesive Method- i.e. paper/tape or sticky vinyl.

P.S. Dimensions are for Fender Squier Jazz Bass. Fretboard size being indicated in relevant pdf. Measured from the end of the nut, to the 20th fret.

### Installing

1. Print out the a4 pdf (ToPrintToScale.pdf)

2. Cut out the notes horizontally.

3. Tape it to your fretboard. 

```
Example, making sure your clear tape is bigger than paper. Putting tape on the upside facing printout. Then laying it down on the fretboard. You don't have to take the strings off, and can kinda slide it underneath.
```

4. Know your frets forever.

I originally just used paper and clear cello tape. Worked fine. Lasts about 1.5 years I'd say, depending on tape quality.

Currently printing out a vinyl version for fun/permanence, will update on how it goes.

To edit, use the .ai file in illustrator. Groups and layers are self explanatory.

## Colours?
Ive tried many colour themes for getting things 'legit'. Originally tried LAB colour spacing in 12. Then HSB Max Saturation, the wheel/12. Settled on using this graphic found by Sienna Wood.

LAB Colour wasn't great because the colours didnt seem spaced out enough, and clumped to the 4 primaries.

HSB Max Saturation wasn't great because max saturation doesn't take into account the greyscale value. Yellow at max saturation is super bright, whereas blue is quite dark.
I had edited these to be more similar in value, then realised it started to look like the image from Sienna Wood anyway.
As I have already memorised her colours, I thought I may aswell reuse it. I've buffed some colour differentiation for all the colours though. i.e. red is darker and more saturated, the greens/blues are more seperated (adding magenta to darken some etc)

tl;dr settled on a modified Sienna Wood palette due to self history in remembering colours.

In the illustrator file, the fret colours are mapped to the swatches. Therefore, you can change the swatches to change the fret colours globally.

If anyone actually uses this please let me know! We can be colour bass friends! :D

Thanks to Sienna Wood for the circle of fifths image! I use it very frequently when learning and analysing songs.
